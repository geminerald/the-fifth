                    <p class="faction-info">Not an organised faction but rather the different forms of natural creatures who live in the Vale. The WitchWood itself was until recently corrupted by a Dragon Orb which took over the Nadarlich who is essentially one with the forest. 
                    The Fifth have broken the link between the Dragon Orb and Nadarlich; freeing him to act of his own will and returning him and the forest to their previous state. The Nadarlich has provided the Fifth with the ability to travel through the WitchWood at great speed and
                    given permission for the Tiri Kitor to traverse his airspace.</p>

                    <p class="faction-info">The dwarves of Hammerfist Holds are an ancient race of miners and engineers. When they became aware of the approaching Horde the sent an expiditionary force to intercept and potentially delay their advance at Skull Gorge Bridge. They were ultimately unsuccessfull but 
                    after the Fifth rescued the expiditionary force, destroyed the bridge and showed the dwarves a map showing that they were not a part of the Red Hand's plans for invasion they have allied themselves with the Fifth and agreed to provide forces and mercenaries for the defence of Brindol</p>

                    <p class="faction-info">Red Rock is the largest Gnomish city in the region. A technocracy with many guilds they are largely unaffected by the Red Hand thus far. However in an effort to hide their mountain from the ivading army they have inadvertendly sealed the vent for the poison gas which the mountain produces. They require urgent aid to release the trapped mining team and ensure the safety of their people</p>

                    <p class="faction-info">A wild community of elves who live on the edges of the swamps and woods of the Vale. Known as great flyers they have a symbiotic relationship with their mounts and they practice flying from an early age. Recently they have come under attack in their home swamps
                    from Saarvith and his Dragon, along with other unspeakable abominations. They are currently evacuating - only the destruction of the Facility in Rhest and the elimination of all threats in this region can stop them fleeing.</p>

                    <p class="faction-info">Survivors from Drellin's Ferry and other hamlets in the region have come flocking to Brindol. They are currently living in a tent city outside the walls of Brindol. There are relatively few combatants but those that there are have joined the Brindol militia to fight
                    The non-combatants are mainly seen as a drain on resources in the area and as marauding bands of raiding Tiamat followers infest the region it seems unlikley that they can move any time soon.</p>

                    <p class="faction-info">Free Greenskins who resisted the forced conversion to Tiamat worship and remain fanatically loyal to Grumsh. They have assembled a makeshift warcamp near Brindol and have agreed an uncomfortable truce with the local Human peoples. They will be a 
                    highly effective fighting force in the attack on Brindol, if the truce can hold for that long.</p>
