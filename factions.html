                        for their woodland navigation were soon waylaid and only rescued by the brave actions of the Fifth. After this and the discovery of a map showing that the dwarves were not initially targets of the Horde's invasion they allied themselves
                        with the Fifth and have promised to aid the defence of Brindol when called.</p>
